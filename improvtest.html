        <div class="content">Context: For the past year I've been teaching adults about AI: what it is, what the terms mean, how to use it, the different types of AI they've heard about, etc. One of the techniques I've found best is something I call "AI Improv". First I'm going to tell you what AI Improv is. Then I'm going to tell you some insights to help explain why it works well. Works for you?</div>

        <div class="speaker">Assistant:</div>
        <div class="content">That sounds fantastic and very intriguing! I'm eager to learn more about "AI Improv" and the insights behind its effectiveness. Please go ahead and share the details.</div>

        <div class="content">I'll give you 3 settings where I've done AI Improv. No engagement needed until I'm done.</div>
