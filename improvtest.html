        <div class="content">Context: For the past year I've been teaching adults about AI: what it is, what the terms mean, how to use it, the different types of AI they've heard about, etc. One of the techniques I've found best is something I call "AI Improv". First I'm going to tell you what AI Improv is. Then I'm going to tell you some insights to help explain why it works well. Works for you?</div>

            Setting #1) My company is fashioning itself as an AI first company, but not many people are using AI, especially at leadership levels. Because I am, a few times a week someone grabs 1:1 time with me so I can "teach them" or somesuch. In those sessions I run some form of AI Improv.<br><br>
            Setting #2) One of the things I've done for the past 15 years is help nonprofits understand, adopt, and embrace technologies. Recently, I've been meeting with executive teams at nonprofits who are trying to "learn about AI." One of the first things I try to do with executive teams is some form of AI Improv. Notably, one difference in with this setting is that I try to find the person in the c-suite who is the most into AI. There's always 1 person, I find; there's rarely more than one.<br><br>
            Setting #3) Lots of organizations -- both within my company and outside of my company, are developing strategies and solutions to "teach AI". Most of their strategies and solutions are not based on adult learning best practices, which is an expertise of mine. If I connect with such a team, I try to run some version of AI Improv as a way to demonstrate some key adult learning best practices in action.

    <!-- Assistant's Acknowledgement -->
    <div class="message">
        <div class="speaker">Assistant:</div>
        <div class="content">Thank you for sharing the settings where you apply AI Improv. It seems like a versatile approach that you've successfully integrated across different groups and contexts, from corporate leadership to nonprofit executives and teams focused on AI education. Each setting presents unique opportunities and challenges for engaging with AI and learning principles.</div>

            Thanks Gipity! Ok let's talk about the insights that lead me to AI Improv. After I give you my insights, I'll give you some AI Improv examples. At some point later I'd like you to challenge my insights & examples, but let's not do that now. I'd rather keep building context. Follow me?

        <div class="content">Absolutely, I'm following you. It's important to build a comprehensive understanding of the context and insights that led to AI Improv before diving into critiques or challenges. I'm looking forward to hearing your insights and then moving on to the examples of AI Improv. Please go ahead with the insights.</div>

            Insights:<br><br>
            - While AI is much discussed, many people (especially the ones in the above settings) are not actually using AI at all, and others may use it and give up. Instead, I find that many people are reading about AI (blog posts, articles), listening to podcasts about AI, or talking to their friends & colleagues about AI based on what they've read or heard. My insight is: if you get people to use it,<br><br>
            - Prompt engineering, as a term, is exclusionary. The very terms make many people think that it is hard, not for them, or requires some special skills. This is unfortunate given that using an everyday-AI tool requires what most adults already have -- the ability to write, ask questions, converse.<br><br>
            - Prompting _is_ a skill. It's easy to get started, but impossible to perfect. It's a new skill, and learning new skills is hard. For many adults, it's easier to lean on an existing skill (reading a blog post, listening to a podcast) than to develop a new one.<br><br>
            - For many adults, a gradual release of responsibility pedagogical practice is best. So, when I am doing AI Improv I follow an "I do, we do, you do", to demonstrate AI tools and techniques, then do with the participant, and then have them do it. If someone hasn't use the tools yet, asking them to "drive" the learning is often a mistake.<br><br>
            - It's important to blow people away. I call this "getting to the aha moment in 10 minutes". My goal is that within 10 minutes of a meeting/session starting, we have gotten to a point together that the participant(s) have aha moments -- they "get" something about AI that they didn't get before; they see how it might change their work or personal life; they see something about the human experience might be quite different in the future. Additionally but somewhat a side note: my other goal is ha ha moments...basically, I have fun and they will too.<br><br>
            - I'm going to stop now because I could go on and on. I have many insights related to implementing best practices in adult learning, but I don't think i need to through them. If helpful, the insights are based on Knowles.<br><br>
            Let's move on, time is short!

            Now let me roughly say how AI Improv works. I'm not going to make the below too polished.<br><br>
            Beginning of session: I get a sense for what the learner(s) is working on today or this week. I listen for problems they are trying to solve or tasks they need to complete.<br><br>
            Then: I say something like "Ok, let's muck around with AI! It's fun, I'll drive first. Do you want to work through [xyz thing they just told me about] or do you have another problem or task in mind and want to see how everyday AI can help?<br><br>
            Then: they pick the task, and then I go into "I do" mode. I pull up my favorite AI product for the task.<br><br>
            Example:<br>
            - Participant needs to coach someone they manage on how to work better with a peer where there is conflict. We use an LLM to act as an executive coach, first giving context (describing the situation in some detail), talking about different coaching approaches, and doing role playing where the everyday-AI product acts as either the manager or the report.<br><br>
            - Participant needs to write a project proposal. They struggle with "blank page syndrome" -- getting to a bad first draft is hard, much less a good one. We give context to the everyday-AI tool, and we get to a good first draft within minutes.<br><br>
            - Participant has a day of packed meetings and hasn't had time to review the materials. We feed materials into an everyday AI tool, and get the executive prepared with summaries, questions to ask, suggestions to make.<br><br>
            - Participant gets a lot of emails where they need to say "great job" in some way. It's exhausting and painful to keep up with the emails and respond to them. I pull up an image-gen AI tool to show them how they can have fun by generating images that show their thanks. My go to is a prompt like "give me an image of a beach with rocks on it, and the rocks spell Janet Rocks." Then we do a few more just for fun.<br><br>
            All of the above examples blow people away.<br><br>
            They get to aha and haha moments every single time.<br><br>
            Without fail.<br><br>
            Let me know when you've taken this all in and I'll ask some questions.
