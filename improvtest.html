    Hi Gipity - my shared gpt links are not working. Can you tell me what's wrong?
  </div>

  <div class="message gpt">
    <strong>GPT:</strong>
    I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot the issue with your shared GPT links. Could you provide me with more details about the problem you're encountering?<br><br>
    For example:<br>
    - Are you receiving any error messages when trying to access the shared links?<br>
    - Are these links you've generated using the OpenAI API or another platform?<br>
    - Have you checked if the links are still valid and haven't expired?<br>
    - Is this issue happening consistently, or is it sporadic?<br>
    - Have you tried accessing the links from different devices or browsers to see if the problem persists?<br>
    - Have you made any recent changes to your account or settings that might affect the sharing functionality?<br>
    - Any additional information you can provide will be helpful in diagnosing the problem and finding a solution.

    Can you put our entire conversation so far into a nicely formatted table?
  </div>

  <div class="message gpt">
    <strong>GPT:</strong>
    Sure, here's our conversation formatted into a table:<br><br>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>User</th>
        <th>GPT</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>

    Can you export our conversation into a pdf file for me?
  </div>

  <div class="message gpt">
    <strong>GPT:</strong>
    As an AI text model, I can't directly export files, including PDFs. However, you can copy our conversation and paste it into a word processor or text editor such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs. From there, you can format it as needed and save/export it as a PDF file. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance with formatting, feel free to ask!

    Copying and pasting into word doesn't work because of all the web formatting. Can you give me a raw text of the entire conversation that makes it easier to copy & paste?
