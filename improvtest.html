        <div class="content">Context: For the past year I've been teaching adults about AI: what it is, what the terms mean, how to use it, the different types of AI they've heard about, etc. One of the techniques I've found best is something I call "AI Improv". First I'm going to tell you what AI Improv is. Then I'm going to tell you some insights to help explain why it works well. Works for you?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="message">
        <div class="speaker">Assistant:</div>
        <div class="content">That sounds fantastic and very intriguing! I'm eager to learn more about "AI Improv" and the insights behind its effectiveness. Please go ahead and share the details.</div>

        <div class="content">Setting #1) My company is fashioning itself as an AI first company, but not many people are using AI, especially at leadership levels. Because I am, a few times a week someone grabs 1:1 time with me so I can "teach them" or somesuch. In those sessions I run some form of AI Improv.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="message">
        <div class="speaker">Assistant:</div>
        <div class="content">Got it, that's Setting #1. Please continue with the next settings.</div>

        <div class="speaker">User:</div>
        <div class="content">Setting #2) One of the things I've done for the past 15 years is help nonprofits understand, adopt, and embrace technologies. Recently, I've been meeting with executive teams at nonprofits who are trying to "learn about AI." One of the first things I try to do with executive teams is some form of AI Improv. Notably, one difference in with this setting is that I try to find the person in the c-suite who is the most into AI. There's always 1 person, I find; there's rarely more than one.</div>

        <div class="content">Setting #3) Lots of organizations -- both within my company and outside of my company, are developing strategies and solutions to "teach AI". Most of their strategies and solutions are not based on adult learning best practices, which is an expertise of mine. If I connect with such a team, I try to run some version of AI Improv as a way to demonstrate some key adult learning best practices in action.</div>

            Insights:<br><br>
            - While AI is much discussed, many people (especially the ones in the above settings) are not actually using AI at all, and others may use it and give up. Instead, I find that many people are reading about AI (blog posts, articles), listening to podcasts about AI, or talking to their friends & colleagues about AI based on what they've read or heard. My insight is: if you get people to use it, they'll see the potential (and have fun)<br><br>
            - Prompt engineering, as a term, is exclusionary. The very terms make many people think that it is hard, not for them, or requires some special skills. This is unfortunate given that using an everyday-AI tool requires what most adults already have -- the ability to write, ask questions, converse.<br><br>
            - Prompting _is_ a skill. It's easy to get started, but impossible to perfect. It's a new skill, and learning new skills is hard. For many adults, it's easier to lean on an existing skill (reading a blog post, listening to a podcast) than to develop a new one.<br><br>
            - For many adults, a gradual release of responsibility pedagogical practice is best. So, when I am doing AI Improv I follow an "I do, we do, you do", to demonstrate AI tools and techniques, then do with the participant, and then have them do it. If someone hasn't used the tools yet, asking them to "drive" the learning is often a mistake.<br><br>
            - It's important to blow people away. I call this "getting to the aha moment in 10 minutes". My goal is that within 10 minutes of a meeting/session starting, we have gotten to a point together that the participant(s) have aha moments -- they "get" something about AI that they didn't get before; they see how it might change their work or personal life; they see something about the human experience might be quite different in the future. Additionally but somewhat a side note: my other goal is ha ha moments...basically, I have fun and they will too.<br><br>
            - I'm going to stop now because I could go on and on. I have many insights related to implementing best practices in adult learning, but I don't think I need to go through them. If helpful, the insights are based on Knowles.<br><br>
            Let's move on, time is short!

        <div class="content">Your insights provide a solid foundation for understanding why AI Improv has been effective in your experience. They highlight important considerations about adult learning, the accessibility of AI technology, and the importance of practical engagement. The emphasis on hands-on use, demystifying the technology, fostering new skills through a supportive learning process, and ensuring engaging and revelatory moments align well with established adult learning theories.</div>

    <div class="message">
        <div class="speaker">Assistant:</div>
        <div class="content">I've taken in the description of how AI Improv works, and it's quite insightful and innovative. The approach is hands-on, tailored, and clearly designed to make AI accessible and relevant to the participants' immediate needs. By focusing on real problems or tasks that the participants are facing and demonstrating how AI can be utilized to address these issues, you're not only demystifying AI but also showcasing its practical value in everyday contexts.</div>

        <div class="speaker">User:</div>
        <div class="content">Great. Now is where you do some work, my fingers are tired. Here's my goal: I want to explore ways to expand AI Improv. My only goal is to share it with people who might find it interesting. I'm not concerned about making money or credit. First, I want to create something I could give to an expert facilitator to use with adults who are not familiar with AI. I don't know the person, and I won't talk to them, so everything has to be in the guide we give them. The facilitator's context is that they will be in some setting where they are teaching someone or many people about AI. I want to describe to them AI Improv in a way that they know what it is and can go do it. You can assume the facilitator is an expert and knows a lot about AI. They know overall how to teach people about AI. We are just giving them 1 technique, called AI Improv. Let me know if you have any questions. If you don't, make me something.</div>

        <div class="content">That's pretty good! It's missing examples though (like how AI can help managers manage better, using imagegen for thank you emails, and other examples I gave you above).. Without examples I think it's hard for someone familiar with AI to see "oh I get it, yeah, that could be really useful to adults I work with." So, I'd like to create an Appendix of examples. I'd like each example to be 2-4 sentences long. Can you give me 10 examples? Please use the examples I gave you, and then come up with additional ones.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="message">
